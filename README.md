# django-devblog
This is a basic blog website that can be used to give your users info about your project development. The main technology used here is Django, Python 3, and bootstrap4.

I used Heroku to deploy this website, so some settings have been added to accomodate for that. I'm also in the process of making 'comments' an easily reusable app, so there may be extraneous notes within that app. I plan to create a separate repository that I will move these notes into.
