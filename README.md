# django-devblog
This is a basic blog website that can be used to give your users info about your project development. The main technology used here is Django, Python 3, bootstrap4, and Heroku.

Here is what the project looks like: https://learnerdevblog.herokuapp.com/
I'm using free dynos from Heroku so the website may be "asleep" and take a few seconds to start up.

I used Heroku to deploy this website, so some settings have been added to accomodate for that.
